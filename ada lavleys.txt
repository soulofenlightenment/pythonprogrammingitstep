Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer from the 19th century, best known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine.
She is often considered the first computer programmer for devising an algorithm intended to be processed by the machine.
The only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron, she was tutored in mathematics and logic by her mother, Annabella Milbanke, which was unusual for women at the time.
